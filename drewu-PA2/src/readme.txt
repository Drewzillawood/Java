I apologize that this is all I have for the assignment, I made my choices and assigned priorities elsewhere throughout the duration of this task. I merely tried to pull some tings together just for the sake of turning something in and if that doesn't deserve any points I certainly understand. Just thought it was worth a shot.

Hope grading isn't going too bad, I've gotta deal with CS 227 grading now D:

Best of luck!
